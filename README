NAME
       Labyrinth - An extensible website in a box.

SYNOPSIS
         use Labyrinth;
         my $labyrinth = Labyrinth->new();
         $labyrinth->run();

DESCRIPTION
       Documentation overview for Labyrinth.

       Labyrinth began life in 2002, with a small set of plugins to enable
       various features of web site management. The core set of plugins are
       now available as the Labyrinth-Plugin-Core package, with this package
       providing the core functionality that drives the Labyrinth framework
       system.

       See the individual files for more details on how to use them.

FUNCTIONS
   Constructor
       new()

   Methods
       run run provides the interface between the CGI and the modules

       load()
           Loads plugins found under the plugins directory.

       action($action)
           Calls the appropriate plugin method.

ADDITIONAL FILES
       Additional files are needed to enable Labyrinth and any installed
       plugins to work correctly. These files consist of SQL, HTML template
       and configuration files, together with some basic CSS and Javascript
       files.

       Please see the Labyrinth-Demo package for a set of these files.

       However, these files are only the beginning, and to implement your
       website, you will need to update the appropriate files to use your
       layout design.

ADDITION INFORMATION
       Although Labyrinth has long been in development, documentation has not
       been a priority. As such much of the documentation you may need to
       understand how to use Labyrinth is the code itself. If you have the
       inclination, documentation patches would be very gratefully received.

       The Labyrinth website [1] will eventually feature a documentation site,
       wiki and other features which are intended to provide you with the
       information to use and extend Labyrinth as you wish.
