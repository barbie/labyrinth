Labyrinth
=========

A Website Management Framework - extensible websites in a box.

Labyrinth began life in 2002, with a small set of plugins to enable various 
features of web site management. The core set of plugins are now available as 
the Labyrinth-Plugin-Core package, with this Core package providing the core 
functionality that drives the Labyrinth framework system.

The intention for Labyrinth was always to make building simple websites easy.
The idea of a "website in a box" that has subsequently been used by other
website applications in other languages. Sadly Perl has fell way behind with 
this, and Labyrinth ultimately still aims to provide several solutions to the
kinds of websites people want to implement quickly, such as blogs, wikis and
basic content sites. 

The fact that Labyrinth can be extended further and build on the core structure
for virtually any website you may want is its target audience. Labyrinth wasn't
built for complex corporate websites, and there are many other applications and
frameworks available if that is what you want.

Labyrinth also tries to keep it simple, so that it is fairly quick to get
going, without the need for several weeks of design. 

Please note the tests for this code is very basic. If you wish to help me out
and can add to the test suite, please feel free.

INSTALLATION

See the INSTALL file for full instructions.

DEPENDENCIES

The core Labyrinth distribution requires the following Perl modules to be 
installed:

  Archive::Extract
  CGI
  CGI::Cookie
  Config::IniFiles
  Cwd
  Data::Dumper
  Data::FormValidator
  Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Upload
  Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Words
  Data::FormValidator::Filters::Demoroniser
  Data::Phrasebook
  Data::Phrasebook::Loader::Ini
  DBD::mysql
  DBI
  Digest::MD5
  Encode::ZapCP1252
  File::Basename
  File::Copy
  File::Path
  File::Slurp
  File::Spec::Functions
  HTML::TagCloud
  Image::Size
  IO::File
  JSON::XS
  Log::LogLite
  MIME::Lite
  MIME::Lite::TT::HTML
  MIME::Types
  Module::Pluggable
  Regexp::Assemble
  Regexp::Common
  Session::Token
  Template
  Text::Wrap
  Time::Local
  URI::Escape
  WWW::Mechanize

In addition the following are used within the core application for RSS support.
However, the RSS feed is ran from a independent script and necessary for the 
running of a website.

  XML::Atom
  XML::Atom::Feed
  XML::Atom::Entry
  XML::RSS

Note RSS support and functionality is likely to be abstracted out to a plugin
in the future.

ADDITIONAL FILES

Additional files are needed to enable Labyrinth and any installed plugins to 
work correctly. These files consist of SQL, HTML template and configuration 
files, together with some basic CSS and Javascript files.

Please see the Labyrinth-Demo package for an example set of these files.

However, these files are only the beginning, and to implement your website, 
you will need to update the appropriate files to use your own layout design.

ADDITION INFORMATION

Although Labyrinth has long been in development, documentation has not been a 
priority. As such much of the documentation you may need to understand how to 
use Labyrinth is the code itself. If you have the inclination, documentation 
patches would be very gratefully received.

The Labyrinth website [1] will eventually feature a documentation site, wiki 
and other features which are intended to provide you with the information to 
use and extend Labyrinth as you wish.
